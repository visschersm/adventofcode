# Adding a new solution
Chose the year for which you want to add a solution.
Add a csharp code file with the name: 'solutiondd.go' where the 'dd' is replaced with the day for which you want to add the solution.

In the code file include the following:

```
package yYYYY

type SolutionDD struct{}

func (s *SolutionDD) Part1(filename string) {
	
}

func (s *SolutionDD) Part2(filename string) {
	
}

```

In the code file replace YYYY with the year and DD with the day for which the solution is.
