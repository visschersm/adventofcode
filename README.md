This year (2021) I started doing the https://adventofcode.com
I enjoyed it so much I saved the assignments to I can tryout them in different code languagues. Next year (2022) I probabbly won't have that much of a stable internet connection since I will traveling a lot but I want to keep on practicing my coding skils. Let see what nice solutions I can think of and learn in all kinds of code languages. 

# Building the CLI tool
- Make sure that you have golang installed by running ```go version```
- Run the command: ```go build -o aoc.<extension of executable on your device> aoc_cli```
- This will create a executable and place it in the root folder.
- Now you can run the cli and use it to generate and solve the challenges of the adventofcode.
