# Building the CLI tool
- Make sure that you have golang installed by running 
```pwsh
go version
```
- From the root folder: 
```pwsh
go install .\cli\
```
- This will install the adventofcode cli to $GOPATH/bin.
- Now you can run the cli and use it to generate and solve the challenges of the adventofcode.
