I think I will reduce the list of languages for now a bit to a list of languages with working runners. Keep the challenge at the code challenge while still challenging myself using different languages.

The first day I got solved using golang. It was supposed to be bash but I could not get my bash runner, well running. I need to put some time in fixing my different runners. Maybe even setup some testing to keep it working for the years to come. The same happend to me on day two with getting my kotlin runner working. I did get it working in the end but it took me a lot of time which resulted in me only finishing up the first part.

In 2022 I decided to build a small cli tool to generate random solution files based on different language template files. I may have overdone it a bit but I think it is a nice challenge to try a lot of different languages this way. So this year I am trying to use the cli to try some different languages.

This year (2021) I started doing the https://adventofcode.com
I enjoyed it so much I saved the assignments to I can tryout them in different code languagues. Next year (2022) I probabbly won't have that much of a stable internet connection since I will traveling a lot but I want to keep on practicing my coding skils. Let see what nice solutions I can think of and learn in all kinds of code languages.
